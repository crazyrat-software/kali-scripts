kali_scripts
============

Useful scripts for Kali Linux distro.

# dnscheck.py
Simple Python3 script which tries to resolve domains using provided list of DNS servers. If it fails to do so it means that DNS server is not open resolver. Otherwise you should double check if your DNS configuration is desired.

#kali_quicksetup.sh
Very dirty way for quick setup of freshly installed Kali Linux instance. Works for me, should work for you. No warranty though.
